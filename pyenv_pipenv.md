- Run `pipenv install --python 3.8.8` to init the Pipfile and its lock file
- Run `pipenv shell` to activate the virtual env
- Run `pipenv install <package name>` to install the dependency needed, add --dev for development need (testing) only
- Run `exit` to deactivate the virtual env

# pyenv
`pyenv install --list` to see the available Python versions you can install

`pyenv versions` to see the installed Python versions

`pyenv global <Python version>` to set an installed Python version as global

`pyenv local <Python version>` to set an installed Python version file .python-version for a given project folder

`pyenv uninstall <Python version>` to uninstall an already installed Python version

# pipenv
`pipenv install` to create a virtual environment

`pipenv install --python <Python version>` to create a virtual environment indicating the desired Python version (that you have installed using Pyenv)

`pipenv --rm` to delete the current virtual environment

`pipenv shell` to activate the created virtual environment

`exit` to deactivate an already activated virtual environment

Now letâ€™s take a look at the summary of the commands after the virtual environment has been activated:
